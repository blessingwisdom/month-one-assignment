            <li>200g pancetta or guanciale, diced</li>

            <li>1 whole egg</li>
            <li>100g Pecorino Romano cheese, finely grated</li>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Add spaghetti and cook according to package directions until <strong>al dente</strong>. Reserve 1 cup of pasta cooking water before draining.</li>
            <li>While pasta cooks, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add diced pancetta and cook for 5-7 minutes until <em>golden and crispy</em>. Add minced garlic and cook for another 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together egg yolks, whole egg, and grated Pecorino Romano cheese. Season generously with <mark>freshly ground black pepper</mark>.</li>
            <li>Add the hot, drained pasta to the skillet with pancetta. Remove from heat and quickly toss to combine, allowing the residual heat to warm the pasta.</li>
            <li>Gradually pour the egg mixture over the pasta while tossing continuously. Add pasta water a little at a time until you achieve a <strong>creamy, silky sauce</strong> that coats each strand.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately in warmed bowls, topped with additional Pecorino Romano cheese and a generous grinding of black pepper.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips & Notes</h2>
        <p><strong>Temperature is key!</strong> The pasta must be hot enough to cook the eggs but not so hot that they scramble. If the sauce becomes too thick, add more pasta water. If it's too thin, toss over very low heat for a few seconds. <em>Never add cream</em> - the creaminess comes from the egg and cheese emulsion. For best results, use <u>freshly grated cheese</u> rather than pre-grated, as it melts more smoothly into the sauce.</p>
